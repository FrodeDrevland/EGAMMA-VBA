Installation
======================================

To integrate the EGAMMA library into Excel, you have two distinct installation methods to choose from, depending on your needs and preferences.

Installing as an .xlam Add-in for Global Access
If you require the EGAMMA library to be accessible across all Excel workbooks on your system, the optimal approach is to install it as an .xlam add-in. This method ensures that the library's features are readily available in Excel, no matter which workbook you open.

Importing VBA Code for Workbook-Specific Use
Alternatively, if your intention is to utilize the EGAMMA library in only a few selected workbooks, you may opt to import the library's code directly into those workbooks via Excel's VBA code editor. This approach allows for a more targeted use of the library, without affecting the global Excel environment.

For comprehensive guidance on executing these installation methods, please refer to the following instructional pages, which offer step-by-step procedures tailored to each approach.
