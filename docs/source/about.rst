Introduction
________________
The expanded gamma distribution extends the traditional three-parameter gamma distribution to also accommodate left-skewed data. Its versatility is particularly beneficial in project cost estimation and other fields where such data patterns are common. Although the distribution has been in de facto use in Scandinavian cost-estimation practice since the 1970s, it has only recently been formally defined. The `EGAMMA-VBA` library provides a Python implementation of the expanded gamma distribution, along with the tools for its practical application.

The `EGAMMA-VBA` library enhances builds on implementation of the gamma distribution, enhancing it to incorporate the specialized attributes of the expanded version. Additionally, `EGAMMA-VBA` introduces capabilities beyond those offered by SciPy, such as three-point estimation. This method, used with expert judgment, determines the most likely, optimistic, and pessimistic scenarios. Unlike standard practice, which often places optimistic and pessimistic estimates at the 10th and 90th percentiles, `EGAMMA-VBA` offers the flexibility to choose any percentile range, allowing for customized three-point estimation according to user preference.
